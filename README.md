# Deep Learning with Pytorch (with Keras like helper functions)

This project contains may illustrations of classifcation & regression using Pytorch

Highlight of the project is `pyt_helper_funcs.py` - utility functions for Pytorch,
which provide a Keras-like interface for training model, evaluating performance
and predicting results from model.

## pyt_helper_functions.py
Provides helper functions and utility class (pytModule) derived from nn.Module, which
provides a Keras like interface to train & evaluate model and generate predictions

## Illustrative Examples
* `pyt_breast_cancer.py` - binary classification on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using Pytorch ANN
* `pyt_iris.py` - multiclass classification of Iris dataset using Pytorch ANN
* `pyt_wine.py` - multiclass classification using Pytorch ANN on UCI Wine dataset
* `pyt_mnist_dnn.py` - MNIST digits classification with Pytorch ANN
